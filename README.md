# carcin.vim

This is Vim plugin to provide utility functions for [carc.in][].

## motivation

[carc.in][] is a good webpage for sharing Crystal code.  However it is webpage, I want to use such like it in my editor.  So, I created this plugin.


## install and setting

```viml
" If you use neobundle.vim:
NeoBundle 'MakeNowJust/carcin.vim'
" If you use Vundle.vim:
Plugin 'MakeNowJust/carcin.vim'
" Or if you use another plugin manager, please install carcin.vim
```

Now, you can type `:CarcinRun` in Crystal file and run it ;)
